//Create a new Scala file, for example, HelloScala.scala, and add the following code:
object HelloScala {
  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {
    println("Hello, Scala!")
  }
}

//Simple Class:
//A simple class is a basic class with fields and methods. It does not have any special features like those provided by case classes or abstract classes.
class Person(name: String, age: Int) {
  def greet(): Unit = {
    println(s"Hello, my name is $name and I am $age years old.")
  }
}

// Usage:
val john = new Person("John Doe", 30)
john.greet() // Output: Hello, my name is John Doe and I am 30 years old.

//Case Class:
//A case class is a special class optimized for immutable data. It automatically provides methods for equality comparison, pattern matching, and more.
case class Point(x: Int, y: Int)

// Usage:
val point1 = Point(2, 3)
val point2 = Point(2, 3)
println(point1 == point2) // Output: true (due to auto-generated equality method)
