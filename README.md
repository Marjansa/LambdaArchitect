# LambdaArchitect
Applying the Lambda Architecture with Spark, Kafka, and Cassandra
Applying the Lambda Architecture with Spark, Kafka, and Cassandra involves implementing a data processing system that can handle both batch and real-time data streams effectively. Apache Spark is used for fast and efficient batch processing, Kafka serves as a distributed event streaming platform for real-time data ingestion, and Apache Cassandra provides a NoSQL database for storing batch views of processed data, enabling scalable and low-latency data processing and analysis.
